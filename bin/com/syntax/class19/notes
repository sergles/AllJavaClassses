CONTRUCTORS:

1) It is a special block of code/similar to a method that executed when we create an of a class
2) The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.
3) They must have same name as the name of the class
4) Constuctors do not have return types, not even void.
5) We can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods.

SIMILARITIES BETWEEN CONSTRUCTORS AND METHODS:
1) Both have parameters
2) Both have access modifiers like private/public and protected/default

DIFERENCES CONSTRUCTORS AND METHODS:
1) As we can use any name for our method we can not use any name for our constructor, the must have same name as our class.
2) Constructors cannot return values as methods can.
3) Contructors are automatically called when an instance of a class is created.

WHEN SHOULD WE USE CONSTRUCTORS:
When we want to control the initialization for our field
