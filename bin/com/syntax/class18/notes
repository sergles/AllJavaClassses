Yet another type of variables
1) local
2) Instance variables
3) Static variables

local variables:
any variable that is declered inside the method or a block like while
loop for loop if condition or inside the constructor are called local variables.
Properties of local variables.
1) we cant acces them outside of the block, for example:
if (2>1){
int x=10 // this  variable will not be accesible outside of the curly brackets of IF condition
}
x=20 - wrong
2) as soon as we are done with method these local variables are destroyed
and memory is freed and is available to be  used by other programs,
which means they are very efficient managing memory and thats why they always recommeded
over instace variables

Instance variables:
All of the variables which are declared outside of the main methods, blocks,
constructors but inside the class are called instance variables.
1) Memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created
and it stays in memory unless we are done wit the closing bracket.
2) They are highly discouraged because thay are not efficient in handling memory (RAM).

Static variables:
They are declared outside ofthe method, constructor and block of codes with static keyword

Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are just keyword (Private public protected) that help use reduce the visibility of
our variables and methods so tha no one else from other classes or packages can modify our data
Private:
If we use Private access modifier with out variable or method we can only access that variable
from the same class. We use it to protect critical information

class Account{
private int balance;
void depositMoney(){
if (properChannel, int money){

balance = balance+money

}
}
}

class hacker{
balance = 10000; // CE Cannot access
}
Default:
this is not a keyword it is a behaviour which is assigne to the methods
pr properties automatically if we are not assigning any access modifier.

package1
class{
String car;

}
package2
class family{
car = "i am your little brother i am using your car today forgive i destroy it"

}
