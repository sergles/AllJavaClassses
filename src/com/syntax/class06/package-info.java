/*
 *   We thinking of going shopping
 *    first we check if store has sale
 *    if no-> no shopping
 *    if sale -> we go for shopping
 *         ask for price:
 *         if price<50 -> we give 10% discount
 *         if price is between 50-100 -> 20% discount
 *         if price between100-500 -> 40% discount
 *         if price more than 500 -> 50% discount
 *    
 *    
 *    Your program should calculate final price discount!
