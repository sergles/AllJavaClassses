ABSTRACTION:

Abstraction is a process of showing the functionality to the user and hiding the implementation details.
We can achieve the abstraction in Java in 2 ways:
1) Abstract classes and other one is Interfaces.
Abstract classes can have abstract methods, we can implement abstract methods in our child classes.
Rules to follow:
We can have as many abstract methods in class as we want.
1) To declare an abstract we can use abstract keyword
2) We cant have abstract methods as private because they will never be inherited
and we will not be able to provide implementation for those methods
3) Same way we cannot declare our methods as final because final methods can never be overridden
abstract class ParentClass{

public abstract method1();
}

INTERFACES:

Interfaces always have fields as public, static and final.
