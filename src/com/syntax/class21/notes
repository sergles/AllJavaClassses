Inheritance:

Inheritance is mechanism in java through which we can use the fields and methods
from one class to other class  without rewriting a single line of code/repeating the code
from the class from which we are inheriting.

Benefits of using inheritance:
1) Cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution.
2) It helps use reduce duplicate code.
3) Saves time
4) Reusing the same code again.

Disadvantages:
1) Classes are tightly coupled together in Parent class effect Child class
Class Parent{
int money;
void print(){
System,out.println("Money ="+Money);
}
}
Class Child extends Parent{
main(){
Child child = new Child()
child.print();
}
}

we can access our static fields and methods using class names and using objects of the class by using Class name
